    The Chia node and services come with a JSON RPC API server that allows you to access information and control the services. 
    These are accessible via HTTPS, WebSockets, or via client SDKs. The ports can be configured in `~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml`. 
    The RPC ports should not be exposed to the internet. TLS certificates are used to secure the communication 
    [using mutualTLS](https://github.com/dkackman/chia-api/wiki/Mutual-TLS).

    The full node uses port 8555 by default.
  version: 1.7.1
